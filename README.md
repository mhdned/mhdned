I'm Mehdi Nedaee. During my time in the Programming field, I realized that even though our world as computer people is made of just 0 and 1, we can still create amazing things with them.

> _Maybe this vision feels a bit outdated with quantum computing_

I'm a backend developer who‚Äôs always learning ‚Äî not just to build showcase projects or chase money, but to create real, useful software.
I care about building applications that are practical, well-designed, follow clean architecture and standards, and above all, are easy for users to interact with. That mindset pushed me to collaborate with the <a href="https://github.com/FEZtool-team">**FEZtool team**</a> ‚Äî working on both a web-based app and the FEZrs Python library for remote sensing tools.

# ![Alt Text](./images/titles/Goals-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only) ![About me](./images/titles/Goals-light.png#gh-light-mode-only)

Sure, every developer dreams of writing code that's used by the masses ‚Äî or creating something so powerful it attracts thousands of users and clients.

But maybe there's something even more beautiful...

Instead of just writing code wrapped around algorithms and data structures, imagine blending disciplines ‚Äî where technology meets fields like architecture, medicine, geology, or any domain that can benefit from digital tools.

The real joy comes when we collaborate across boundaries and build something meaningful. Something that helps. Something that matters. That, to me, is where the magic happens.

- ‚öôÔ∏è I'm loyal to _no_ tech ‚Äî one day it's NestJS, the next it's a random Python script that somehow does everything.
- üß† Open-source is my therapy and my stress ‚Äî I laugh, I cry, I `git commit`.
- üéÆ Obsessed with:
  - **Don't Starve Together** (ironically, I often forget to eat while coding)
  - **Brawlhalla** (DONT TRY THIS GAME)
  - **Potion Craft** (a game about alchemy)
- ‚öΩÔ∏è I _really_ understand football tactics... but let's just say my stamina is more suited for keyboard battles than running 20 meters.
